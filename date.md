Hey Jess. I've really enjoyed our conversations there at church last time, and I was thinking it would be great to continue them in a more relaxed setting. Would you be interested in grabbing hot chocalate and/or going to see the lights at temple square (there are my other options too) or diner at Somi Vietnamese Bisto next week Friday or Saturday? I'd love the opportunity to get to know you better. I am open also open to any other that what works best for you. ðŸ˜Š


Hi Jess! I genuinely enjoyed seeing you at church last time, and I've been thinking it would be wonderful to continue them in a more relaxed setting. How about grabbing hot chocolate and/or going to see the lights at temple square (there are my other options too) next Friday or Saturday? If that doesn't appeal to you, a dinner at Somi Vietnamese Bistro is another choice. I'm also flexible with and open to other options that work best for you about the activity and the day. I'd really like to get to know you better. Let me know what you think!ðŸ˜Š
