"Dear Jak,

I've observed that we have some important differences that need clarification. To ensure we are on the same page moving forward, I'd like to address these matters promptly. The focus is on the delicate balance between friends, family, and the business aspect of my primary residence, which operates primarily as an Airbnb.

The current house I reside in is predominantly run as an Airbnb and is not intended for use by friends or family. Here's what this means:

Given the property's primary use for Airbnb, specific regulations apply to friends and family. Airbnb guests take precedence over family members and friends in terms of privacy, security, and overall conformity.

Outlined below are critical rules and laws concerning the property, emphasizing its primary function as an Airbnb with private rooms and shared spaces:

Family members and friends should not enter or leave the property when guests are present and the family member or friend does not reside on the property. This is essential to uphold guest privacy, security, and residential privacy rules.

While the property is occupied by guests, family members and friends may only visit temporarily and must adhere to all rules and regulations applicable to Airbnb guests without exception. Generally, I discourage friends and family from visiting or staying on the property when guests are present, except in cases where they may not fully comprehend or are unwilling to adhere to the laws, rules, and regulations governing their presence during guest stays.

On occasion, I may allow friends and family to temporarily store their belongings here, but this permission does not grant them the right to access the property like guests. They should only access the property when necessary, determined by the host, and not at the discretion of the friend or family member. Belongings stored on the property should not be frequently used unless the individual is a guest or residing on the property. Friends and family members should not store their belongings in the property if they will frequently use these belongings when they are not guests or are not living on the property. Friends and family members' belongings should not be stored or left in any of the guests' private rooms, shared spaces, or public areas. Any items left by friends or family members in these spaces will be disposed of automatically without further notice.

To enforce these guidelines, a security system, including smart home features and locks, has been implemented. Friends or family members are not permitted to enter or leave the property when guests are present unless deemed necessary by the host.

Understanding this fine line between guests, friends, and family members during guest occupancy is crucial to avoiding frustration or inconvenience.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,

[Your Name]"






Dear friends and family members,

I've observed some important discrepancies between us on certain crucial matters, and I believe addressing these issues promptly will help us align our perspectives. This pertains to the interplay of friends, family, and the business aspect of my primary residence, which is primarily operated as an Airbnb.

In essence, my current residence is predominantly run as an Airbnb and is not intended for use by friends or family. Here's a breakdown of what this means:

Given the property's primary use for Airbnb, specific regulations apply to friends and family. Airbnb guests take precedence over family members and friends in terms of privacy, security, and overall conformity.

Outlined below are critical rules and laws pertaining to this property while it primarily operates as an Airbnb with private rooms and shared spaces:

Family members and friends should not have access to enter and leave the property when it is occupied by guests and the family member or friend is not living on the property. This is essential to preserve guests' privacy, security, and adherence to residential privacy rules.

Even if family members or friends have access (keys or codes) to enter the property, they should not do so without permission or invitation while guests are present and the family member or friend is not residing on the property.

While the property is occupied by guests, family members and friends may only visit temporarily. During their visit, they must comply with all rules and regulations that guests must follow without exception. Generally, I discourage visits or occupancy by friends and family when guests are present, except in cases where the friend or family member may not fully comprehend or be unwilling to understand the laws, rules, and regulations governing their presence during guest stays.

On occasion, I may allow friends and family members to temporarily store their belongings here, but this permission does not grant them the right to access the property like guests. They should only access the property when necessary, as determined by the host. Belongings stored on the property should not be frequently used unless the individual is a guest or residing on the property. Friends and family members should not store their belongings on the property if they will frequently use these belongings when they are not guests or are not living on the property.

To enforce these guidelines, a security system, including smart home features and locks, has been implemented. Friends or family members are not supposed to enter or leave the property when it is occupied by guests and will not have access to the property except when necessary, as determined by the host.

Understanding this fine line between guests, friends, and family members when the property is occupied by guests is crucial to avoiding frustration or inconvenience.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
