Dear, Jak, I have noticed that we are not been on the same page on very few things that are very important and critical. To clarified them I would like to address the issues now so we on the the same page from now now. It is the matter of friends, family and business. There is a fine line between friends, family, and business. 

The current house where I live, my primary residence is run mainly for business, as Airbnb, and definitely not for friends or family. What does it mean? 

As the property is mainly used for airbnb here are the regulations concerning friends and family. Airbnb guests, when present or when occuping the property, take priorities over family members and friends. Their privacy, security, and conform take priorities over that of family members and friends. 

Here are the critital rules and laws pertaining this property while it is mainly used at Airbnb with private rooms and shared spaces.

1. Family members and friends should not have access to enter and leave the property when the property is occupied by guests and when the family member or friend is not living on the property. This violate guest's privacy and security and residential privacy rules. 
2. Family members and friends should not have access to enter the property while guests are present and the familly member or friend is not living on the property. Even if the familly member or friend has access (keys or codes) to enter the property, he or she should not enter the property without permission or invitation while guests are present and the familly member or friend is not living on the property.
3. While the property is occupied by guests  family members and friends may only visit temporally. While visiting they must obey all rules and regulations guest must obey with no exception. Normally I do not allow friends and family members visit or occupy the property when guests are present exceptional when the friend or familly member does not understand or is not willing to understand the laws, rules, and regulations that governs their presence  when guests are present.
4. Occasionally I may allowed friends and family members to temporally store they beloging here, but only temporally. However, this does not grant the friends or family members to guest's right to access the property. Friends and familly members should not have their beloging stored in the property they may only access once or twice or just remove their belogings from the property when they need to. Or have dayly or constant use of their belogings when they become guest or are living on the property. Friends and familly members should not store their belogings in the property if they will frequently use these belogings when they are not guests or are not living on the property. Friends and familly members belogings should not be stored or left in any of the guests'private rooms and spaces and any of the guests' public spaces or shared spaces. Any item lefts by friends or familly members on any of the guests spaces either private space or shared spaces will be disposed of automatically without further notice. 

For this reason the security system (smart home, smart locks, etc) has been implaced to inforce this. A friends or familly member is not supposed to enter and leave the property when the property is occupied by guests will not have to access the property except when necessary. And this necessity is determined by the host, not the friend or familly member. 


So to avoid any frustration or inconience, it is critical to understand the fine line between guests, friends, and familly members when the property is occupied by guests.
