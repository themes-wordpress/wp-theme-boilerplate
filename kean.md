There must be in place at least two documents for the me to decide or proceed with this project. A legal agreement or a binding covenant between you and me and a document providing all everything (purpose, functionalities, audience, budget, etc) about the newsletters website. You may provide the legal document or I can draft one. As for the document providing all and everything about the newsletters as far as design, development, devops, maintenance, etc is concerns, it will be in your best interest to provide it. If I were the one to provide you, it may be costly very quickly. However, I will provide you a document in a form of a guideline to drap this document. I may also refer you to a consulting service that can help you draft this document.
