Welcome! I have a guest who needs to utilize the workspace desk in the office, and currently, your personal belongings are occupying the space. If you are not a guest and not actively using the desk, it is crucial that you promptly remove all your personal items. This will allow the guest to make use of the space without any inconvenience. In the event that the guest needs to relocate your belongings to accommodate their needs, they will not be held responsible for any damage or loss that may occur during or after the process. Therefore, it is highly important that you clear the desk of all your personal belongings at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your cooperation!
